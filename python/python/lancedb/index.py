class BTree:
    """Describes a btree index configuration

    A btree index is an index on scalar columns.  The index stores a copy of the
    column in sorted order.  A header entry is created for each block of rows
    (currently the block size is fixed at 4096).  These header entries are stored
    in a separate cacheable structure (a btree).  To search for data the header is
    used to determine which blocks need to be read from disk.

    For example, a btree index in a table with 1Bi rows requires
    sizeof(Scalar) * 256Ki bytes of memory and will generally need to read
    sizeof(Scalar) * 4096 bytes to find the correct row ids.

    This index is good for scalar columns with mostly distinct values and does best
    when the query is highly selective. It works with numeric, temporal, and string
    columns.

    The btree index does not currently have any parameters though parameters such as
    the block size may be added in the future.

    This index stores a compressed (quantized) copy of every vector.  These vectors
    are grouped into partitions of similar vectors.  Each partition keeps track of
    a centroid which is the average value of all vectors in the group.

    During a query the centroids are compared with the query vector to find the
    closest partitions.  The compressed vectors in these partitions are then
    searched to find the closest vectors.

    The compression scheme is called product quantization.  Each vector is divide
    into subvectors and then each subvector is quantized into a small number of
    bits.  the parameters `num_bits` and `num_subvectors` control this process,
    providing a tradeoff between index size (and thus search speed) and index
    accuracy.

    The partitioning process is called IVF and the `num_partitions` parameter
    controls how many groups to create.

    Note that training an IVF PQ index on a large dataset is a slow operation and

        Create an IVF PQ index config

        Parameters
        ----------
        distance_type: str, default "L2"
            The distance metric used to train the index

            This is used when training the index to calculate the IVF partitions
            (vectors are grouped in partitions with similar vectors according to this
            distance type) and to calculate a subvector's code during quantization.

            The distance type used to train an index MUST match the distance type used
            to search the index.  Failure to do so will yield inaccurate results.

            The following distance types are available:

            "l2" - Euclidean distance. This is a very common distance metric that
            accounts for both magnitude and direction when determining the distance
            between vectors. L2 distance has a range of [0, ∞).

            "cosine" - Cosine distance.  Cosine distance is a distance metric
            calculated from the cosine similarity between two vectors. Cosine
            similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an
            inner product space. It is defined to equal the cosine of the angle
            between them.  Unlike L2, the cosine distance is not affected by the
            magnitude of the vectors.  Cosine distance has a range of [0, 2].

            Note: the cosine distance is undefined when one (or both) of the vectors
            are all zeros (there is no direction).  These vectors are invalid and may
            never be returned from a vector search.

            "dot" - Dot product. Dot distance is the dot product of two vectors. Dot
            distance has a range of (-∞, ∞). If the vectors are normalized (i.e. their
            L2 norm is 1), then dot distance is equivalent to the cosine distance.
        num_partitions: int, default sqrt(num_rows)
            The number of IVF partitions to create.

            This value should generally scale with the number of rows in the dataset.
            By default the number of partitions is the square root of the number of
            rows.

            If this value is too large then the first part of the search (picking the
            right partition) will be slow.  If this value is too small then the second
            part of the search (searching within a partition) will be slow.
        num_sub_vectors: int, default is vector dimension / 16
            Number of sub-vectors of PQ.

            This value controls how much the vector is compressed during the
            quantization step.  The more sub vectors there are the less the vector is
            compressed.  The default is the dimension of the vector divided by 16.  If
            the dimension is not evenly divisible by 16 we use the dimension divded by
            8.

            The above two cases are highly preferred.  Having 8 or 16 values per
            subvector allows us to use efficient SIMD instructions.

            If the dimension is not visible by 8 then we use 1 subvector.  This is not
            ideal and will likely result in poor performance.
        max_iterations: int, default 50
            Max iteration to train kmeans.

            When training an IVF PQ index we use kmeans to calculate the partitions.
            This parameter controls how many iterations of kmeans to run.

            Increasing this might improve the quality of the index but in most cases
            these extra iterations have diminishing returns.

            The default value is 50.
        sample_rate: int, default 256
            The rate used to calculate the number of training vectors for kmeans.

            When an IVF PQ index is trained, we need to calculate partitions.  These
            are groups of vectors that are similar to each other.  To do this we use an
            algorithm called kmeans.

            Running kmeans on a large dataset can be slow.  To speed this up we run
            kmeans on a random sample of the data.  This parameter controls the size of
            the sample.  The total number of vectors used to train the index is
            `sample_rate * num_partitions`.

            Increasing this value might improve the quality of the index but in most
            cases the default should be sufficient.

            The default value is 256.
